This is a program written to help you organize yourself more effectively, and it also gave me a good oportunity to work with the moment.js library. On launch it should determine what day and what month it is and display that info just below the header along with boxes that you can fill out containing your work days schedule. The program will save your entries into local storage and load them in the next time you refresh the program as well.
